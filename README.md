# MazeSolver
A simple maze solving program that uses the A* pathfinding algorithim to solve a .txt maze.

# Motivation
I was motivated to do this project when I had learned about Dijkstra's Pathfinding Algorithim in my Data Structures and Algorithims class, and later became even more interested when I found [Devon Crawford's A* Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-YPj5Vt0oQ&t=315s).
